        //Function to return a random choice of rock, paper or scissors for the computer.
        //
        //1. Use Function Declaration and give it name getComputerChoice.
        //2. Create a variable to store a randomly generated number. Create a variable to store computed choice
        //3. Use Math.random() method to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
        //4. Multiply the outcome by 3 and use Math.floor to round down to the nearest number.
        //5. Use an if statement to test if the random number is less than 1, greater than 1 but less than 2, greater than 2 but less than 3.
        //6. For each condition, assign computed choice variable either rock, paper or scissors.
        //7. Return computed choice variable.
